## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-24

### Added
- **Core Lambda Function**: Fast ECS auto-scaler based on SQS queue depth
- **Hybrid Architecture**: SQS + EventBridge + Lambda for sub-minute scaling response
- **Scale-to-Zero**: True cost optimization with minimal idle costs
- **Production Ready**: Proper error handling, logging, and monitoring
- **Easy Configuration**: Environment variables and Serverless Framework integration
- **Multiple Triggers**: Immediate SQS-based scale-up and periodic EventBridge monitoring

### Features
- **Fast Scale-Up**: 10-30 second response time vs. 5-15 minutes with CloudWatch
- **Intelligent Scale-Down**: Configurable threshold-based scaling to zero
- **Dual Monitoring**: SQS triggers for immediate response, EventBridge for proactive monitoring
- **Cost Optimization**: Pay only for actual compute time, no idle ECS task costs

## Version History

- **1.0.0**: Initial release with core auto-scaling functionality
- **Unreleased**: Development and testing phase

## Migration Guide

### From CloudWatch Auto-Scaling
1. **Install Dependencies**: Install Serverless Framework and Node.js
2. **Configure Parameters**: Set your ECS cluster, service, and SQS queue names
3. **Deploy**: Run `serverless deploy` with your configuration
4. **Test**: Send a message to SQS to verify scale-up behavior
5. **Monitor**: Use CloudWatch logs to monitor scaling operations
6. **Optimize**: Adjust scaling thresholds based on your workload patterns

### Configuration Changes
- **Scale-Up Target**: Set maximum concurrent tasks for your workload
- **Scale-Down Threshold**: Configure how long to wait before scaling to zero
- **Monitoring Rate**: Adjust EventBridge trigger frequency (minimum 1 minute)
- **Queue Configuration**: Customize SQS settings for your message patterns

## Breaking Changes

None in this release.

## Deprecations

None in this release.

## Known Issues

- **EventBridge Minimum**: Cannot set monitoring frequency below 1 minute due to AWS limitations
- **ECS Service Limits**: Maximum scaling speed depends on ECS service configuration
- **SQS Visibility**: Long-running tasks may require visibility timeout adjustments

## Roadmap

### Future Versions
- **1.1.0**: Advanced scaling policies and custom metrics
- **1.2.0**: Multi-region and cross-account support
- **1.3.0**: Machine learning-based scaling predictions
- **2.0.0**: Support for other compute services (EC2, Fargate, etc.)

### Planned Features
- **Custom Metrics**: Integration with CloudWatch custom metrics
- **Predictive Scaling**: ML-based workload prediction
- **Cost Optimization**: Advanced cost analysis and recommendations
- **Multi-Service**: Support for scaling multiple ECS services
- **Web Dashboard**: Management interface for monitoring and configuration
